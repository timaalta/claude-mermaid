## Project Overview

This appears to be a new/empty project directory named "claude-mermaid". The project structure and dependencies are not yet established.

## Common Commands

Since this is a new project without a package.json or build configuration, standard commands will need to be established based on the technology stack chosen during development.

## Architecture

The project architecture will be defined as development progresses and files are added to the repository.

## Notes

- This is a new project with no existing files or configuration
- Development setup and build processes should be established based on project requirements
- Once package.json or other configuration files are added, this file should be updated with relevant build, test, and development commands
